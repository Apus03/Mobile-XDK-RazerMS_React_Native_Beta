#### Risk Analysis

Document: [INFORMATION RISK ASSESSMENT HANDBOOK](https://razermis.sharepoint.com/sites/RMSDocLib/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FRMSDocLib%2FShared%20Documents%2FRMS%20CENTRAL%20REPOSITORY%2FRMS%20IT%20%28%20RMS%2DIT%2Dxx%29%2FRMS%2DIT%2D006%20RMS%20IS%20Risk%20Management%2FRMS%20Information%20Risk%20Assessment%20Handbook%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FRMSDocLib%2FShared%20Documents%2FRMS%20CENTRAL%20REPOSITORY%2FRMS%20IT%20%28%20RMS%2DIT%2Dxx%29%2FRMS%2DIT%2D006%20RMS%20IS%20Risk%20Management)  
Formula: ```Risk Score = Asset Value X Impact X likelihood```

Asset Value: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)  
(List all the web page, functions or features that involve in this MR.)

Impact: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)   
(List down all the impact when something wrong happen on this changes or when this changes got bug/error. Write no impact if it not.)
+ Buyer :
+ Merchant:
+ RMS:
+ Bank/Processor:

Likelihood: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)  
(For the bug/incident type issue/merge request, mention here how frequent it happen. For others type issue/merge request, just write new implementation.)

- [ ] New implementation
- [ ] Rare - May only occur in exceptional circumstances; simple process; no previous incidence of non-compliance
- [ ] Unlikely - Could occur at some time; less than 25% chance of occurring; non-complex process &/or existence of checks and balances
- [ ] Possible - Might occur at some time; 25 â€“ 50% chance of occurring; previous audits/reports indicate non-compliance; complex process with extensive checks & balances; impacting factors outside control of organization
- [ ] Likely - Will probably occur in most circumstances; 50-75% chance of occurring; complex process with some checks & balances; impacting factors outside control of organization
- [ ] Almost certain - Can be expected to occur in most circumstances; more than 75% chance of occurring; complex process with minimal checks & balances; impacting factors outside control of organization

Risk Score: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)
